Description: This package provides low level IO for Robotis Dynamixel servos.
 Fully supports and was tested with AX-12, AX-18, RX-24, RX-28, MX-28, RX-64, EX-106 models. Hardware specific constants are defined for reading and writing information from/to Dynamixel servos. This low level package won't be used directly by most ROS users. The higher level dynamixel_controllers and specific robot joint controllers make use of this package.
